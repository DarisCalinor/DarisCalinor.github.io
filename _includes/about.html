          <p>I’m writing lines of code everyday. I like creating web applications and user interfaces. Before this, I was an
            civil engineer worked in various international projects.</p>
          <p>My favorite stack right now is React.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. I also have interest in Java
            and Python these days. I prefer to use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for database solutions. I’m excited to expose new
            technologies and challenges all the time.</p>
          <p>I’m a huge fan of Netflix Series and love to watch everything about sci-fi and mystery. Beside playing games and
            bullet journaling you can find me on Melbourne’s street for random exploring moments. My greatest weakness is
            against to cookies, especially with a delicious coffee.
          </p>
          <p>I have graduated from Dokuz Eylul University in Izmir, with a double major with environmental and civil engineering.
            After working in construction and IT sectors, I’ve decided to do which I love the most: Coding!</p>

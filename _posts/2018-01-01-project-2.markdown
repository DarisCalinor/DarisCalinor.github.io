description: Just feeling not OK? Don't blame it on the boogie, <em>SMASH THE KEYBOARD!</em><br>Smash the Keyboard actually is not about breaking your keyboard. It is for relaxing and be more creative. It is a portable animation and sound kit to create live animations. It is using only circles for now. However, I'm planning to add rainbows, unicorns and a pinch of Force. It is made with pure JavaScript with the help of Paper.js and Howler.js on HTML's canvas element.
